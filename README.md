Extended List for DokuWiki
==========================

This plugin extends DokuWiki's list markup syntax to allow:  
 &ensp;1) html5 description lists, as well as ordered/unordered lists  
 &ensp;2) start any number of an ordered list and give any number for member items  
 &ensp;3) break long item into multiple lines indented by at least two spaces  
 &ensp;4) class attribute for lists block  

Lists can be nested within lists, just as in the standard DokuWiki syntax.


```
  -  ordered list item            (DokuWiki standard syntax)
  *  unordered list item          (DokuWiki standard syntax)

  ;  description list term, compacted/reduced column width
  ;; description list term, column width is NOT reduced
  :  description list item

  ; term  : need two spaces before ":" when writing dt/dd pair in one line
```

Ordered list also starts with actual number followed by period and space (`". "`):

```
    100. start from hundred
    105. skip 101 to 104
```

You may write longer list items in consecutive indented lines of text:

```
    * Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur 
      adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor 
      incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
```
